\section{Introduction}
During the class of Software-Engineering we were introduced in the language of java as an object-oriented 
programming language. The main advantages are the expandability and the very comprehensive looking of 
the code.

In order to reinforce our knowledge in object-oriented programming we were asked to design a software
which manages a food-delivery service. There are several stakeholders in such a system, such as 
clients, restaurants. The software we created is a first approach to handle such a system which we
designed with respect to the open-closed principle in order to be easily extensible to further functions.
Following, our process of implementation is described, as well as the important choices we made in 
terms of software design. In the second part the problems in terms of coding that we encountered are 
discussed. Then the use of JUnit-tests and a \textit{testing-coverage-plugin} is described.
Furthermore there is user's guide added to this report to guarantee a smooth entry in the use of the
software.
