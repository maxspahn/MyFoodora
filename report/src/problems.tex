\subsection{Allocate a \textsc{Courier} to an order}
\label{sub:allocate_a_courier_to_an_order}

Beside the use of the Strategy-pattern to choose between the different delivery policy, there were
some other important choices for the implementation of this feature. The \textsc{allocate} method 
is written in the two different implementations of the Delivery interface. Since the system is 
just used locally by one user at a time, it was not possible to create a interaction of ordering
by a customer and the accepting of the delivery by a courier. In order to imitate some this 
behavior we worked with a accepting-probability for the courier, which can be set in the core of
the \textsc{MyFoodoar} system. 

The fact that a courier can reject the delivery of an order caused a problem when allocating the 
courier to the order. We solved this problem with a \textit{while-loop} that only ends when
a courier is found who is available and accept the order. In order to avoid that one courier who
has rejected an order does not get the same order once again, he is added to a temporary list of
couriers. We find this problem while testing the code with the \textit{JUnit-Tests}. The tests 
also revealed an error in the allocating algorithm. Before we did not check if the chosen 
courier was \textit{On-Duty}.

\subsection{Exceptions}
\label{sub:exceptions}

In our first approach we tried to avoid to avoid any kind of \lstinline|Exception| because we were
not convinced of its utility. We handled the possibility that there might occur wrong inputs at
several places with simple \lstinline|System.out.println()|. At first this seemed to be a
sufficient solution. As we continued to implement further parts of the system we realized that it
was becoming more and more confusing where the \lstinline|System.out.println()| is actually 
invoked. The solution was obviously the implementation of \lstinline|Exception| and we sacrificed
some time in their creation. Later in the project-work we realized that this choice was the right
one since the implementation of the \textsc{Command-Line-User-Interface} and the \textsc{GUI} were
much easier this way.
